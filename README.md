jquery infinite scroll
======================

JQuery plugin for ajax-enabled infinite page scroll.
There are a lot of jQuery plugins for infinite page scrolling function.
However none of them matched my needs when I faced the problem.
So this is a very simple plugin which makes ajax call to load more data on the page and gives some basic callbacks like data loading started or data did loaded.
